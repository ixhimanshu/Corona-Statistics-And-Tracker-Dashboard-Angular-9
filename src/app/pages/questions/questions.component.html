                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                    aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                    mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel
                    unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1
                    out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
                    Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                    diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty
                    breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

                <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to
                    person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
                    catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs
                    out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                    person who is sick. </p>
                <p>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                    findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <hr>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact
                    with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.&nbsp; See previous answer on “How does
                    COVID-19 spread?”</p>

                        <hr>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.
                    The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people
                    with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the
                    disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild
                    cough and does not feel ill.&nbsp; WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission
                    of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <hr>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial
                    investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is
                    not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread
                    and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to
                    clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.&nbsp;</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and
                    through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen
                    cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                    have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so
                    check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                    precautions:</p>
                <p></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
                        and water.<br>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
                        viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                    <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                        sneezing.<br>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their
                        nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
                        including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
                    <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                        Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
                        virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                        your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the
                        used tissue immediately.<br>Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene
                        you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                        attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br>Why?
                        National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in
                        your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the
                        right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other
                        infections.</li>
                    <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is
                        spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places &nbsp;– especially if you are an older
                        person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.<br>Why? You have a higher chance of catching
                        COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;"><br></p>
                <h3>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where
                    COVID-19 is spreading</h3>
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone) </li>
                    <li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as
                        headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is
                        essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a
                        mask to avoid infecting other people.<br>Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical
                        facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and
                        others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>
                    <li>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may
                        be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
                        provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.<br>Why? Calling in advance will allow
                        your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also
                        help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>

                <p>The risk depends on where you &nbsp;are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak
                    unfolding there. </p>
                <p>For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now
                    places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or
                    visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities
                    are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with
                    any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control
                    efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some
                    other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                    situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation
                    worldwide. <br></p>

                <p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults.
                    However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It
                    is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and
                    their loved ones. </p>We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones
                and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and
                good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities
                including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings. <p>Learn more about how to

                <p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of

                    COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and

                    through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans -
                    this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has
                    not been identified.</p>
                <p>Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the
                    virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently
                    experiencing.</p>

                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected
                    person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. <strong>These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They
                        quickly fall on floors or surfaces.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19,
                    or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your
                    hands. </p>
