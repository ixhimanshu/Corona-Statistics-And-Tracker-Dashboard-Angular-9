    <h2>How dangerous is the virus?
    </h2>
    <p>There are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel
        coronavirus: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#repro">Transmission Rate (<strong>Ro</strong>)</a> - number of newly infected people from a single
            case</li>
        <li><a href="/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/">Case Fatality Rate (CFR)</a> - percent of cases that result
            in death </li>
        <li>Determine whether <a href="/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/#asy">asymptomatic transmission </a>is
            possible</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="repro">How contagious is the Wuhan Coronavirus? (Ro) </h2>
    <p>The <em>attack rate</em> or <em>transmissibility</em> (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated
        by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced <em>R-nought</em> or <em>r-zero</em>), which represents the average
        number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus.</p>
    <p>WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5. <sup>[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
    <p>Other studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58. <sup>[<a
                href="#ref-23">23</a>]</sup>. </p>
    <p>Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between <strong>1.5 and 3.5.</strong> <sup>[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>][<a
                href="#ref-6">6</a>][<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
    <p>An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear.</p>
    <p>For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0.</p>

    <h2 id="fata">Fatality Rate (<em>case fatality ratio</em> or <em>CFR</em>) of the Wuhan Coronavirus</h2>
    <p><em>See full details: <a href="/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/"><strong>Coronavirus Fatality
                    Rate</strong></a></em></p>
    <p>The novel coronavirus' case <strong>fatality rate</strong> has been estimated at around <strong>2%</strong>, in
        the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020 <sup>[<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</sup> . However, it noted
        that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality
        rate figure.</p>
    <p> A prior estimate <strong><sup>[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</sup></strong> had put that number at 3%. </p>
    <p>Fatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists.</p>
    <p>For comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%.</p>
    <h2 id="incubation">Incubation Period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear) </h2>
    <p><em>See full details: <a href="/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/"><strong>COVID-19 Coronavirus
                    Incubation Period </strong></a></em></p>
    <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 (estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14
        days, and 10-14 days, <a href="/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/">see details</a>), during which the
        virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom (<em>asymptomatic transmission</em>).</p>

    <p>According to early estimates by China's National Health Commission (NHC), about 80% of those who died were over
        the age of 60 and 75% of them had
        pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and

            the virus.</li>

    <h4> Patient who died in the Philippines was a 44-year old male</h4>
    The patient who died in the Philippines on February 2, in what was the first death occurring outside of China, was a
    44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who was admitted on Jan. 25 after experiencing fever, cough, and sore throat,
    before developing severe pneumonia. In the last few days, â€œthe patient was stable and showed signs of improvement,
    however, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours resulting in his demise."
    according to the Philippine Department of Health.
    <h4>Serious Cases of 30 year old patients in France </h4>
    <p>
        As of Jan. 29, according to French authorities, the conditions of the two earliest Paris cases had worsened and
        the patients were being treated in intensive care, according to French authorities. The patients have been
        described as a young couple aged <strong>30 and 31 years old</strong>, both Chinese citizens from Wuhan who were
        asymptomatic when they arrived in Paris on January 18 <sup>[<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]</sup>.</p>
    <h4><strong>Age and Sex of the first deaths as reported by the China National Health Commission (NHC) </strong></h4>
    <p> The NHC reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm on January 22, 2020. The deaths included 13

    <h2>Comparisions:</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
            <li>Every year an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die in the world due to complications from seasonal influenza (flu) viruses. This figure corresponds to 795 to 1,781 deaths per day due to the seasonal flu. </li>
            <li>SARS (November 2002 to July 2003): was a coronavirus that originated from Beijing, China, spread to 29 countries, and resulted in 8,096 people infected with 774 deaths (fatality rate of 9.6%). Considering that SARS ended up infecting 5,237 people in mainland China, Wuhan Coronavirus surpassed SARS on January 29, 2020, when Chinese officials confirmed 5,974 cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). One day later, on January 30, 2020 the novel coronavirus cases surpassed even the 8,096 cases worldwide which were the final SARS count in 2003.</li>
            <li>MERS (in 2012) killed 858 people out of the 2,494 infected (fatality rate of 34.4%).</li>
